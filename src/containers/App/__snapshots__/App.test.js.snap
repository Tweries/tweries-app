        Although the Duke of Windsor never specifically used the Windsor knot, he did favor a wide triangular knot. In actuality, the Duke achieved his trendsetting look by tying a Four-in-Hand with specially made wide and extra thick ties. The Windsor knot was invented by the public as a way to imitate the Duke's knot style. There are several derivatives of the Windsor that are all referred to by the same name. The Windsor delivers a symmetrical and solid triangular knot that works best with a spread collar. This knot is also mistakenly referred to as the "Double Windsor" knot.
