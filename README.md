> Does anybody have a script or app that will send a file to Twitter, one line per tweet? I don't like any of the tweetstorm apps I've found (most of which break up the tweets at stupid places), so would prefer to just edit a file and send it.

## Features

- [x] A single text box (which includes spell check) that I can enter the entire long post into

- [x] I want the app to then break that up into tweet-length chunks

- [ ] Breaking lines at reasonable punctuation, with a preference to periods over commas.

- [ ] I want to be able to override its choices with a manual linefeed.
